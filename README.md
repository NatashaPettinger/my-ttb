## About the Project

Keeping track of your spirits manufacturing is a lot of work! This is a fullstack web app that records the data on your 
* üåæ raw materials inventories
* üõÅ ferments
* ü•É distillations
* üõ¢ warehouse operations
* üì¶ processing operations
* and more 


that are necessary to make filling out your monthly TTB reports a breeze üçÉ. Built for distilleries who are just starting out and cannot afford to subscribe to the popular paid solutions.

### Tech Stack

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Demo
[myTTB](https://#)
```
To avoid signing up, you may log in with the following credentials:
- Email: WeLikeWhiskey@gmail.com
- Password: drinkwhiskey!1234
```
Demo is currently offline.
~~Not all functionality is available in the demo. All pages will be viewable, but form submissions will not lead to changes in the database.~~


### Features
* Secure login with JWT
* TTB form templating

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You must have node installed in order to run the back end.


  ```bash
    npm install npm@latest -g
  ```


### Run Locally
1. Clone the project
  ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/natashapettinger/myttb-client.git
  ```

2. Go to the project client directory and install dependencies
  ```bash
    cd myTTB/client
    npm install
  ```

3. Navigate to the project server directory and install dependencies
  ```bash
    cd ../server
    npm install
  ```

5. Make sure you have your [environment variables](#environment-variables) saved in your `.env` file in the server/config directory.

6. Start the client and server

    a) With nodemon
    ```bash
      npm run dev
    ```

    b) With node
    ```bash
      npm run start
    ```

7. Navigate to the local host port that the client is running on in your browser.

### Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to your `.env` file in `server/config/.env`

`PORT: <port>` (the frontend is set to fetch from http://localhost:8000/api, and setting this to 8000 will not require any changes in the front end if running locally)

MIDDLE WARE for AUTH.
